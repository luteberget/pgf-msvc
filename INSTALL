The compilation steps are:

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

If you want to use the statistical ranking in the parser then you
have to compile your grammar with the option '-probs=grammar.probs',
where grammar.probs must contain a tab separated file with
the probabilities for all functions in the abstract syntax.
In order to enable the named entity recongizer for the ParseEngAbs
grammar you also have to add the option '-literal=Symb' while compiling.

Note For Mac OSX users
----------------------

You have to comment out the following line in config.h:

   #define HAVE_STATEMENT_EXPRESSIONS 1

This has to be done AFTER you have called './configure', but before you call 'make'!

(Tested on Mac OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion with XCode installed)
