# Compiling libPGF on MSVC

This repository contains a few changes made to the Grammatical Framework ([homepage](http://grammaticalframework.org), [repository](http://github.com/grammaticalframework/gf)) to compile its C runtime component on the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (MSVC).

I have tried to keep the changes minimal. MSVC does not fully conform to the C99 standard.

## Build files generated by CMake

## DLL Exports
CMake exports all functions, but not data.
Have added `GU_API_DATA_DECL` and `PGF_API_DATA_DECL` on these to 
be able to redefine **COMMIT**

## MSVC C99 support
MSVC does not have full C99 support. Restrict **COMMIT**.

## GCC-specific C features
Empty struct **COMMIT**
void arithemtic **COMMIT**
